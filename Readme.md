Photo Album Exercise
====================

Use this repository as an example for getting started with GitHub Actions and/or
OpenShift. It contains:

1. Container sources to produce a statically-generated photo album website.
2. GitHub Actions workflows that build the image and host it with GitHub Packages.
3. Kubernetes manifests that host the built image in an OpenShift cluster.

This repo is not meant to stand alone, see [these docs]() for a detailed guide.
